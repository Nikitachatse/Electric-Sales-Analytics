# Streamlit Dashboard for Trend Analysis

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
- This project involves creating an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** to explore and analyze trends. 
- The dashboard is designed to help users gain insights into data trends and understand the hype around 
- specific topics or metrics. The project involves data cleaning with **pandas** and uses various visualization 
- techniques to make the data intuitive and accessible.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, Streamlit, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Visualization Tool:** Streamlit
- **Data Source:** Kaggle

## ðŸš€ Project Objective
- The goal of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze trends in the 
- dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dashboard allows users to explore key metrics, identify trends, and derive meaningful insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Workflow
- 1. **Data Collection:**
   - Sourced data from Kaggle in CSV format.
   - Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for data analysis.
- 2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and filtered data as required.
   - Performed necessary transformations to create new features if required.
- 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed key metrics using statistical analysis and visualization techniques.
   - Created visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots to show trends and patterns.
 4. **Dashboard Development:**
   - Created an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
   - Implemented widgets such as dropdowns and sliders to allow users to filter data dynamically.
   - Added descriptive charts to enhance understanding of the data and its trends.
5. **Deployment:**
   - Deployed the Streamlit app for public access.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
  - Analyzed various trends based on key metrics like time, category, or other relevant factors.
  - Visualizations helped users understand the distribution and hype around different data points.
